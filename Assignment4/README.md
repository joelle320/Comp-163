# Description
The **Sims: College Life Adventure Game** is a text-based game where you get to play as a college student. You make choices about your classes, study habits, and how you spend your semester. Your decisions change your GPA, stress, study hours, and social life. The game also shows how branching logic and conditionals work in Python.

# Features
- Your GPA, study hours, social points, and stress level change based on what you choose.
- Pick Easy, Medium, or Hard classes.
- Choose a subject to study (Programming, Math, English, or History) that affects your grades and stress.
- Decide if you want to focus on grades, social life, or try to balance both.
- There are 6 different ways your semester can end depending on your choices and stats.

# How Branching Logic is Used
- Sets up variables for your student profile and shows them at the start.
- *Choosing Classes: Uses if, elif, and else with comparison operators (>=, <=, etc.) to affect your outcomes based on GPA.
- Study Choices: Checks if your subject choice is valid using in and not in and uses and/or for conditions that affect your GPA, social points, and stress.
- Combines everything with nested if statements and uses == and != to decide your final outcome. Your ending depends on your stats and final choice.
