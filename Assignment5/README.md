# Description  
This project contains three short Python programs that demonstrate how loops and conditional logic work in different situations. 

Collatz Sequence Generator
 - begins with a number and repeatedly applies the Collatz rules until the sequence reaches 1. It shows the entire sequence of numbers and also counts how many steps it took.
 Prime Number Checker
- tests whether a number is prime by checking every possible divisor between 2 and the number minus one. It then explains if the number is prime or shows which divisor proves it is not prime. 
Multiplication Table Grid
- creates a neatly formatted table of products from 1 to 10, displayed in aligned rows and columns.  

# How It Works  
- Collatz: Uses a while loop to continue until the number becomes 1. It prints each number in the sequence and counts the steps.  
- Prime Checker: Uses a for loop to go through all possible divisors. It reports if the number is prime or not.  
- Multiplication Table: Uses nested for loops to calculate each product and print a 10×10 grid.  

# AI Help  
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025) to correct the code formatting and explain indentation errors.
